## Acknowledgments

Thanks to [@correlucas](https://github.com/correlucas) for [his feedback to use a `single class` to manage the content that is mostly the same for the 3 columns](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/3column-preview-card-html-css-UuKD2J8USI#comment-631b055605bcd1e28bacbaf8).

Now, `.car-column` acts as this single class to manage content instead of using `section` as a selector to manage.
